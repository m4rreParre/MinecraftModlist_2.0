## [Essential Client Sided Minecraft Mods]( https://m4rreparre.github.io/MinecraftModlist_2.0/)   
Hey there! I'm excited to share my latest project with you â€“ my very own website! This is my first real website, and I'm pretty proud of it!

So, what's it all about? Well, it's a mod downloader for essential client-sided mods that I typically use. Instead of having to juggle between 18 different CurseForge pages and hunt for the right version, I created this modpack maker. Now, you can pick and choose your own set of mods and download everything in one convenient zip file. Just extract it into your mods folder! (I'll be adding an update selector soon, too.)
